Context Update:

We have set up a basic React application using Create React App in the 'client' directory of the project. This React application will serve as the front-end for our NFT minting site.

Inside the 'client/src/components' directory, we have created a new component called 'MintNFT.js'. This component will handle the functionality of connecting the user's MetaMask wallet and initiating the NFT minting process.

The 'MintNFT.js' component imports the necessary dependencies, including the 'web3.js' library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and the user's MetaMask wallet.

We have also created two files in the 'client/src/contracts' directory:

1. 'ContractABI.json': This file contains the Application Binary Interface (ABI) of our smart contract in JSON format.
2. 'ContractBytecode.json': This file contains the bytecode of our smart contract in JSON format.

The 'MintNFT.js' component imports the contract ABI and bytecode from these files and uses them to create an instance of the contract using the 'web3.js' library.

The component provides two main functions:

1. 'connectWallet': This function prompts the user to connect their MetaMask wallet and retrieves the user's Ethereum account address.
2. 'mintNFT': This function constructs and sends a transaction to the smart contract's 'mintFree' function, allowing the user to mint a new NFT. The function takes the necessary parameters, such as the token URI and the user's account address.

The component renders a button to connect the user's wallet if it's not already connected, and once connected, it renders a button to initiate the NFT minting process.

With this setup, we have laid the foundation for the front-end of our NFT minting site. The next steps would involve integrating the front-end with the back-end server, handling the minting process on the server-side, and implementing any additional functionality or enhancements required for the application.
